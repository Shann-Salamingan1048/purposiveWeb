            <h2>The Four Communication Styles:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Assertive:</strong>
                    The gold standard! Assertive communicators express themselves clearly, directly, and respectfully. They actively listen and consider others' perspectives while advocating for their own needs.
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Builds trust, fosters collaboration, avoids conflict.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> "I understand your concerns about the deadline. Here's my proposal to ensure we meet it together."</li>
                    </ul>    
                </li>
                <li><strong>Passive:</strong>
                    Passive communicators prioritize the needs of others over their own. They may avoid expressing opinions or disagreements, leading to frustration and resentment.
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> lead to unclear expectations, difficulty building rapport, and feeling unheard.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> (Mumbles agreement to a suggestion they disagree with)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Aggressive: </strong>
                    Aggressive communicators prioritize their own needs and may dominate conversations. They can be overly critical, interrupting, and disrespectful.
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Challenges: </strong> Creates tension, hinders collaboration, damages relationships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong>"That's a terrible idea! We should do it my way."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Analytic:</strong>
                    Analytic communicators focus on facts, data, and logic. They may struggle with emotional aspects of communication and can come across as impersonal.
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong>Can overlook the emotional impact of communication, may not build rapport easily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> "Based on the sales data, the most effective approach is..." (without acknowledging potential anxieties about the change)</li>
                    </ul>    
                </li> 
            </ol>
